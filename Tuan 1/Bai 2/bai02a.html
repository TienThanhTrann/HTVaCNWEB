    <h2><b>Leonhard Euler (1707- 1783)</b></h2>
    <p>Considered the most prolific mathematician of all time, Euler published nearly 900 books. Despite losing his sight in his late 50s, his capabilities across various domains only increased. Euler introduced a famous mathematical expression, a profound connection between complex exponential functions and trigonometric functions, known as Euler's identity: </p>
    <p>&#8494i&#8508 +1 = 0</p>
    <p>He also pioneered many mathematical symbols still in use today, including the symbol 'pi' representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, sin, cos, tan</p>
    <p>cos(x) + sin(x) =&#8494 <sup>(ix)</sup> </p>
    <p>&#8494 <sup>(&#8508i)</sup> +1 = 0</p>
    <p><b>Euler</b> made significant contributions to mechanics and physics, particularly in studying Isaac Newton's laws of motion. Beyond physics, Euler explored astronomy, the theory of curves, cartography, construction, music theory, theology, and philosophy.</p>
